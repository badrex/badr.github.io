Hi üëãüèº I'm Badr, an **AI** researcher and **Language Technology** expert. 

I'm interested in applying AI and machine learning to wide range of problems in **Natural Language Processing** [ text modality üìù ] as well as **Speech Processing** [ audio modality üí¨ ]. I have been excited about broadening language technology to the under-represented languages of the world.    


I hold a PhD in **Computational Linguistics** from Saarland University. My PhD dissertation introduced novel methods for understanding the representation of speech variability in deep neural networks, providing an interdisciplinary perspective that bridges sociolinguistics and language technology. Prior to that, I completed my Master in the [**LCT**](https://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/lct-coli/) program with the prestigious **Erasmus Mundus scholarship** funded by the European Commission. 

I am a currently working as a researcher in the [Language Science and Technology Department](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/department/lst.html) at [Saarland University](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/home.html). I work with [Dietrich Klakow](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=_HtGYmoAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao) and [Bernd M√∂bius](https://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/~moebius/mywww/index.html).


I am always excited to chat and learn more about ...
* AI/LLMs Applications for the social good 
* Language technology and healthcare 
* LLMs for scientific document processing
* Multilinguality, linguistic typology, and language variation
