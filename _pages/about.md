I am a post-doctoral researcher in the [Language Science and Technology Department](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/department/lst.html) at [Saarland University](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/home.html). I am a member of the collaborative research center [SFB 1102: Information Density and Linguistic Encoding](http://www.sfb1102.uni-saarland.de/). I work with [Dietrich Klakow](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=_HtGYmoAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao) and [Bernd MÃ¶bius](https://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/~moebius/mywww/index.html).

My research primarily focuses on representation learning for speech and language processing. Concretely, I am interested in (1) analyzing and understanding the **encoding of linguistic structure** in speech and language models, (2) developing linguistically-informed approaches for **cross-lingual transfer learning**, and (3) bridging between **human language processing** and computational language modeling.

In addition, I always enjoy learning more about...
* Non-native speech processing
* Multilinguality, linguistic typology, and language variation
* Information theory and language structure
* Interpretability of neural networks
